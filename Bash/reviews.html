            <p>When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew that this would attract a lot of attention. Of course having Leonardo in the lead role helped a lot. 


From the trailer, I already know some things. Dreams. All about dreams. But what about dreams? Who are the other people? At first, I didn't really understand what was going on. It was all very confusing to me. But as the movie progresses, I start to understand it and I wanted to watch some more and know more what will happen in the end. The ending. That was, I think, the most intense ending of a movie in a year or probably more than a year. People actually screamed when the screen faded. And of course, people couldn't help but talk about it. It was an open-ended movie where people will have their own endings. My favorite part was Joseph Gordon's fight scene. I think he has the most fun part in this movie.


My rate for this movie is A.</p>

            <p>Whether you watch Inception as a heist movie, a redemption story, or a sci-fi action picture, Christopher Nolan's tour de force of dreams will absolutely work its magic over you. The fact that the film works on so many levels (literally) is an attest not only to the visual queues that make it easy for the audience to follow but to how much in control of all the intricacies its filmmaker had to be.</p>

            <p>Is there anyone on earth who doesn't like Christopher Nolan’s films? Inception is one of his masterpieces. It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.

The film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.

There are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.

The only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.

A curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.</p>

            <p>Ariadne: "Why is it so important to dream?"

Cobb: "Because, in my dreams we are together."

I haven't seen this movie in years, but after re-watching it struck me hard how depressing this was.

Putting aside the action sequences and loud music and a complicate plot, there's a beautiful story about a man trying to get back to his children, without it being cheesy. Well if you really break this movie at it's core, it's about two grieving men (Leo and Murphy), both haunted by the past until they have the strength to accept reality and let them go.

The 'Grow Old Together' scene stuck with me the most.

You can say whatever you want about Christopher Nolan, but his movies are never hollow. I'm also convince that Nolan would be the perfect choice to direct a James Bond movie.

Seriously, throughout the whole movie I was thinking "Man imagine the genius behind Inception directing a Bond movie". The ingredients are right there.</p>

            <p>This is actually a Perfect movie. It is the 2nd perfect movie I've seen and it is flawless in almost every way. Since perfection itself is an imaginary value like Infinity or <a href="https://paperhelp.nyc/">paperhelp</a> that when you add +1 to it, or make it better in any way, that adds to the imaginary state of infinity itself making it factually an imaginary number. There are only a few issues, such as a little too fast pacing, even though the film itself is about 2:17:00 long, and also I would have preferred them not show the helper on the train until After it was revealed to be a 2nd dream state. Also some bland emotional displays overall. Other than these small issues it is as perfect as a movie can be made. Totally Amazing film when you are in the mood for an action movie. WATCH TWICE, or more, as it would be nearly impossible to truly experience this film without seeing it 2 times in short breaks between viewings.</p>
